 * why use generics rather than just "Object"?
 * generics give you compile time type safety -
 * you set the type in your code so that when
 * the code is compiled, that type is set in
 * stone and no other type of object can get in.
 * just using the "Object" type would allow
 * any object type with no restrictions at
 * compile time.
